Block Reward Reallocation
-------------------------

Once v20 activates:

- Treasury is bumped to 20% of block subsidy.
- Block reward shares are immediately set to 60% for MN and 20% miners.

Note: Previous reallocation periods are dropped.
Note: Same changes from PR 5588 but activation is done on v20 instead of Masternode Reward Location Reallocation.
